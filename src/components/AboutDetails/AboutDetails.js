                <p className="AboutDetails__container--text">As income inequality soars, education becomes a necessity in securing our children's futures. Their ability to tame language and articulate their ideas has become essential to acquiring opportunities, and their ability to think-critically by learning to analyse information will position them at the centre of a changing jobs market.</p>

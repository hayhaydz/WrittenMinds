Encouraging children to write stories brings incredible results.



They engage with the lessons, actively trying to create work they can be proud of since their only limit is to include the new.



Students will craft intricate worlds while trying to use fronted adverbials or complex sentences, a contrast to the mundane answering of questions and writing of notes, rarely recapped.



The long-term results come from deliberate practice, a habit of thinking that consumes the child, resulting in compelling stories like this:



*On Aurday the 98th of Jury, I had school, and it was tedious, apart from llama class, where it was amusing watching my friends get spat on. The seven llamas followed me home, which was disconcerting, but then I found a one trillion pound note, but the llamas' ate it. Then, they spat on my fake Gucci bag with all my money inside then I found out they were acid-spitting llamas' so my money and my fake Gucci bag vanished and I lived on the streets only living on llamas'.*



Written by Chesny, aged 12



The above task was simple, Chensy needed to use five new words in her description of the day, but in a classical Chensy style, she thought of something more interesting, she asked: " Can it be fiction?"



And, it sparked a curiosity within me, an eagerness to see the results and she didn't disappoint.



Here is another example from a lesson on using neither/nor with another student:



*The beast spat words of venom, saying, "neither the queen nor king is alive." He drew his sword, pointing it towards the prince and shouted, " you will join them!"*



My point is that parents and educators might get better results by giving their children more freedom when it comes to the format of expression, encouraging them to push the boundaries and negotiate on the flexibility of the task.

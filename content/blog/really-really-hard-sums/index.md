When first tutoring, my students found the descriptive work challenging, because like a handy-man trying to build a house out of scraps, my students were trying to write sentences with ineffective words. We see the impact of small vocabulary pools when children struggle to speak concisely.

Solving this issue is simple, we introduce our children to new words daily, and luckily for you, Writtenminds will upload weekly free spelling sheets.

**How they work:**

Each task requires your child to search for the meaning of five words using a dictionary (preferably offline), writing it inside a spelling book. Afterwards, they'll write two sentences for each word, showing an understanding of the meaning. The final part requires them to read a written scenario and write about it using the word. Here is an example below:

*Scenario one- word: Nocturnal*

*Late at night, a detective was alerted to a missing person case deep within London and must investigate the situation.*



***Student example:***

Late at night, a detective has been alerted to a missing person case deep within London and must investigate the situation.

The mysterious kidnapper was nocturnal, looking from the footsteps it was a light student aged 15. The detective followed the footstep with caution not to go onto a different track. And what he saw in front of him you wouldn't believe.

The task should take 15-30mins every day.

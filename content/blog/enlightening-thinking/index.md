Reading, according to an article by the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/23/can-reading-make-you-smarter), might make us smarter, while increasing our emotional intelligence. The act of following another's story, learning to empathise and read between the lines helps children (adults, too) to think outside the box, learning to adopt an array of perspectives and solutions. 

These benefits improve writing ability and content while bolstering friendships in class. A child is free when they read.

Here are some examples from my tutoring experience of how reading impacts children and their writing.

**More likely to learn new difficult words**

Once a child discovers the habit of writing down words they don't understand and then using a dictionary to find the meaning, they tend to expand their vocabulary rapidly. They see the unknown as a lesson.

They'll start teaching themselves new words and adopting them in conversation. A year ago, one of my students struggled to find synonyms of *many*, repeatedly using *many* in paragraphs, unable to alternate. That's when we started reading more and discovering words such as variety and multiple, raising the level of their work.

**Exposure to new sentence and writing structures**

Short sentences are a plague if overused and many children rely on them, refusing to be creative and adopt longer structures. Reading exposes children to mature and adventurous alternatives, capable of transforming "Lilly went to the park. Her friends joined her" into "Lilly and her friends ran to the park, which had a variety of flowers." 

**Comprehension improves** 

Stories teach children about an array of topics, adding them when discussing history, politics and while participating in general conversations. The constant decoding of meaning encourages in-depth thought, especially if asked to summarise or react to a story.

It is a chance to practice processing information. A powerful skill indeed.

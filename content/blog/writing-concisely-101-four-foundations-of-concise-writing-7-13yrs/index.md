Does your child struggle with passive speech and an inability to articulate themselves? Maybe they write around their points? This issue impacts a variety of children worldwide having negative effects on writing levels and quality of work.\
\
English tutor, Moses Reid, has been tackling this problem for two years by hosting online classes and creating workbooks that introduce kids to techniques such as, synonym searching, sentence restructuring and proofreading techniques.\
\
For Â£10, Moses will be hosting an interactive 1hr30 class with a maximum of 15 students using zoom. He will start with a synonym exercise where students will introduce themselves by finding a synonym for 'exciting' and creating a sentence about themselves.\
\
Afterwards, we'll explore phrases that can be summarised with words, such as 'does not have' being replaced with 'lacks.'\
\
We'll follow by writing our own short story and each student will contribute a sentence that will add important information. Our finishing task will be an editing task where we'll explore proofreading techniques for transforming work into a succinct version. Each student will have ten minutes to edit the text and compare version and ideas, receiving feedback.

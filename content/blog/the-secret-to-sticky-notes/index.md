Many parents wonder about their child's writing level, questioning why it sounds immature and lacks language techniques. The issue usually revolves around proofreading. When a child either forgets punctuation or creates wordy sentences, it comes down to a lack of re-reading.

Few writers can effortlessly write paragraphs without a few mistakes or opportunities for changes, and children are the same. They need to be encouraged to re-read their work, improving and correcting segments.

At Writtenminds, we encourage children to proofread before offering suggestions for changes, usually noting how they notice opportunities on their own. They'll realise tense mistakes, missing punctuation and eventually wordiness.

Here are a couple of exercises that we've developed at Writtenminds, a few workbooks that can boost proofreading skills in children.

**Short sentenes plague**

This type of workbook showcases why short sentences are an issue and how to introduce a variety of sentence lengths/types into text. It walks children through identifying the shorts sentence overuse, how to transform those sentences and who to avoid repeating the mistake too often.

**Wordiness is the enemy**

These workbooks focus on injecting concise structures into writing. We shorten wordy sentences, realising how synonyms allow for brief language. Children will drill changing phrases like "not useful" into "Useless." And, they will practice writing short paragraphs and correcting the multiple issues using our 'five top enemies of conciseness' guide.

We have many more tasks and workbooks, but these are just an insight into how your child can develop a habit of proofreading. They might start checking their chores, too.
